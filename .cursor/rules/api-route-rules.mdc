# Api route rules

while creating an api route, if you need to create a prisma client, create like this

create api routes in "@/app/(api)/api/"

  in the api routes
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import { getServerSession } from "next-auth";
import { authOptions } from "@/app/(api)/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route";
import { slotMachineSchema } from "@/lib/types";

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

get prisma client like this. .
